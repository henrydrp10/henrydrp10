## Hello everyone! ðŸ‘‹ 
### My name is Henry Rubiano Poveda, and I am a Computer Science graduate!

Here you can see some of the different projects I have worked on!

- A Federated Learning approach to a well known Machine Learning problem (Turbofan Engine Degradation datasets) for Predictive Maintenance, using a wide range of Neural Network architectures and Decision Tree Algorithms.
- An IoT system for Real-Time Data Collection and Monitoring using an ESP32 microcontroller and a variety of sensors.
- A MLOps automation Pipeline using Apache Airflow and deployed using Docker, in order to perform churn prediction on the Telecom Customer Dataset.
- A particle system simulation project (fireworks), developed using C++ OpenGL!
- A team software engineering project for events management (Eventlite!), that helped me with useful version control practices such as Issue Tracking, Branching, Merge Requests and Code Review, Unit and Integration Testing, etc... 
- A sorting visualizer, where you can visually experience how an array is sorted using different sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort and Quick sort.
