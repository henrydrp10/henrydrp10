## Hello everyone! ðŸ‘‹ 
### My name is Henry Rubiano Poveda, and I am a Computer Science student!

Here you can see some of the different projects I have taken part of!

- ðŸ“† A team software engineering project for events management (Eventlite!), that helped me with useful version control practices such as Issue Tracking, Branching, Merge Requests and Code Review, Unit and Integration Testing, etc... 
- ðŸ“Ÿ My final year project!! For this project I implemented an IoT system for Real-Time Data Collection and Monitoring.
- ðŸ“½ A sorting visualizer, where you can visually experience how an array is sorted using different sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort and Quick sort. 
- ðŸŽ† A particle system simulation project (fireworks), developed using C++ OpenGL!

And more to come in the near future!
